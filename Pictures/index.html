                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Boris and I'm from Singapore Polytechnic Diploma of Information Technology, class DIT 1A/03.
                    My username online is Synfoxius, if you recognise me
                    then you must play the same video games as I do! I am a 17 year old male this year, just completed
                    Secondary School Education and here I am in doing my Diploma.</p>

                <h2>Why Polytechnic Education and Not Junior College </h2>
                <p>I felt that after 10 years of the same style of education, I decided to try the Polytechnic Education
                    System as I heard it was different from the Primary and Secondary School Education System put in place
                    by the Ministry of Education. I am also a very consistent person, and Secondary School does not reward
                    people with consistency as well as Polytechnic so my heart was set on the Poly Education Landscape. As
                    for why I chose IT, I have a strong interest in the Technology Landscape and I have been reading up
                    about Tech News since Secondary Two and I have built my own computer as well.</p>

                <h2>What do I do in My Free Time?</h2>

                </div>
                <p>Well I play a lot of video games, I guess I'm what normal people call a gamer. I also like to watch Anime
                    and I like to read up about technology. When people are in need of assistance in terms on what laptop
                    they should purchase or whether they should have a custom build gaming computer, I'm always lending a
                    helping hand to my fellow friends. Find out more about what I do in the Interests page above!</p>
