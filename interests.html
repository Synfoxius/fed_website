            <h1>My Interests</h1>
            <p>I, like many other people, also have interests. Read on to find out more!</p>
            <h2>PC Building</h2>
            <p>I developed an interest in PC building since 2016 when I was first fascinated by PC technology through YouTube channels like LinusTechTips and Dave Lee. At the same time I also wanted a custom built computer so that I can customise all my parts and I can play all the latest games. Now it's not so much about playing games but the joy of building computers and seeing the joy in my friends faces when I helped them to research about computer parts and build their computers.</p>
            <h2>Overwatch</h2>
            <p>The video game that I'm hooked onto at this stage is Overwatch, a First Person Shooter game developed by Blizzard Games and published by Blizzard Entertainment. It is a unique take on the genre as there are characters with high and low skill curves to suit everyone's style of playing. I mainly play the Support class and the heroes that I main are Mercy, Moira and Baptiste. I only recently started so I am not that good at the game, but nevertheless it is still fun and relaxing to play with my friends after a busy week!</p>
            <h2>Grand Theft Auto</h2>
            <div id="gta">
                <img src="Pictures/gta.jpg" alt="gta">
            </div>
            <p>One of my all time favourite series, Grand Theft Auto is an open world crime simulator game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. What I like about the game is that it has a rich story and the gameplay is extremely polished. Rockstar Games does not make this series yearly which means they take the time to ensure that every game they release is of top quality. I play Grand Theft Auto Online every now and then so if you play it too we can play together and have fun in the game!</p>
